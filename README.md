# food-menu

A simply React application in which a user selects food items and adds them to a cart. The cart then displays the selected items
and displays a total price. The user can remove items from the order or indeed cancel the entire order.

## **Motivation**

The purpose for creating the food-menu application was simply to develop a simple front-end application using React which
contained JSX (React's markup which is similar to HTML) and CSS. 

## **Tech/Frameworks Used**

React is the Javascript framework used. Node.js is used for the server-side. NPM is used to manage Javascript and CSS modules. Visual Studio Code was used to
develop the files involved.
